## [Unreleased]

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): builds the `default` PlatformIO environment
  and runs `pio check` static analysis on every push/PR.
- Verified on real X4 hardware for the first time.
- **Recent Devices** screen (Dashboard → `Up`): a live, RAM-only feed of the last 16 WiFi/BLE
  observations — type, MAC, RSSI, SSID/name, time since seen — so the device shows what it's
  actually hearing, not just aggregate counts (`lib/SignalCatalog/RecentSightings`,
  `src/activities/devices`).
- **Log Viewer** screen (Dashboard → `Down`): browses and decrypts the encrypted capture log
  on-device, no PC or key entry required — the AES key is already resident in RAM from boot.
  `Left`/`Right` switch between daily log files, `Up`/`Down` page through records 8 at a time.
  Backed by two new `EncryptedLog` methods, `decryptRecordRange()` and
  `recordCountForFileSize()`, which exploit the log's fixed 70-byte-per-record envelope size for
  O(1) random-access seeking instead of scanning from the start of the file
  (`src/activities/logviewer`).

### Fixed

- Dashboard now runs in portrait, not landscape. Landscape put the on-screen footer button hints
  out of alignment with the physical buttons, which are wired for portrait; fixing it properly
  would mean carrying the orientation-aware button remapping layer upstream drops for reader
  page-turning, which this port intentionally doesn't have. Reworked the dashboard layout for a
  tall screen in the process: the creature is now a centered "specimen card" at the top with its
  name/stage/mood/XP bar beneath it, RF stats fill the rest of the screen full-width below that.
- Two remaining `cppcheck` `constParameterReference` findings in `Chrome::drawHeader` and
  `Chrome::drawFooterHints` (both now take `const GfxRenderer&`), the last thing blocking a fully
  green CI run.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-17

Initial build of Pocket Cryptid, built on the CrossPlant/CrossInk hardware foundation
(`freeink-sdk/`, `lib/hal`, `lib/GfxRenderer`, `lib/EpdFont`) with an entirely new application
layer.

### Added

- Passive 802.11 monitor-mode WiFi capture (`lib/RfCapture/WifiSniffer`): beacons, probe
  requests/responses, and best-effort WPA 4-way handshake message detection.
- Passive BLE advertisement scanning (`lib/RfCapture/BleScanner`), never transmits a SCAN_REQ.
- Unique-device deduplication and lifetime stat counters (`lib/SignalCatalog`).
- AES-256-GCM encrypted, device-bound, append-only capture log (`lib/CryptidLog/EncryptedLog`)
  with a companion decrypt tool (`scripts/decrypt_log.py`).
- The cryptid: a procedurally-rendered (no bitmap assets) shadowy creature that evolves through
  five stages driven by capture XP, with a mood tied to how recently it was last fed a new unique
  device (`src/cryptid`).
- Dashboard, Settings, Lore, and Maintenance/Export screens (`src/activities`).
- "Strict partial refresh" pet corner: the creature redraws on its own ~1.2s cadence without
  touching any pixel outside its fixed box, independent of the slower full-dashboard redraw.

### Removed

- Everything reading-related: EPUB/TXT/XTC rendering, file browser, OPDS, KOReader sync, the
  virtual plant pet, WiFi station mode / web server / WebDAV / HTTP OTA, multi-language reading
  fonts and the i18n pipeline, auto-sleep-on-inactivity.
